Yes, my daughter\u2019s limbs are quite different \u2014&nbsp;thus the common term used to describe her disability as having \u201climb differences.\u201d Her left arm stops above the elbow \u2014 a short round nub. Her right arm is a little longer, but still short with no elbow and a small, atypical hand. Her legs are also both shorter, and different lengths at that, but she does have two feet, which she uses for most fine motor skills like writing and assembling lego spaceships. Yes, the doctor was correct about her limbs, but other than that, he didn\u2019t tell us a damn thing!<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultrasound machines are not \u201cfuture predicting machines.\u201d If that ultrasound had been really accurate our appointment might have gone something like this:<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Add any video or audio, even twitter embed<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe width=\"1140\" height=\"641\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/T79f-R8P5SI?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Doctor, chuckles: \u201cCompared to everything else she\u2019s got going on, small potatoes, guys. Like I said, you guys are lucky. I just had to deliver an \u2018asshole\u2019 diagnosis the other day and it was devastating.\u201d<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p> <br>&#8220;The line between pity and empathy is razor thin.

From the looks of it, the girls were pulling a #TBT to their big high school party and dressed like it was a black and white affair. Girls, we know we didn\u2019t TECHNICALLY go to Laguna Beach High School, but where was our invite?<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/themebubble.com\/demo\/webify\/creative\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/8\/2019\/04\/d2phv1q00pk-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-143\" \/><figcaption>Photo Credit: Alex Turner &amp; Co.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Where does it all end?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You may not navigate this interaction perfectly, you might fumble for words or be at a loss, but most people will appreciate your effort and help you in the process. I\u2019ve gone into many, many classrooms to teach children about disability \u2014&nbsp;about my daughter \u2014&nbsp;and I have seen their curiosity and hesitancy turn to acceptance and inclusion in a matter of minutes simply because we took the time to talk about it. In my experience, education doesn\u2019t just make a difference, it makes ALL the difference when it comes to teaching our children about disability and fostering a community of inclusion.<br><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Sadly missing from the reunion were all the guys, namely Stephen.
